# CWE-426: Untrusted Search Path

In an environment where an untrusted or less trusted entity can modify the environment variables, consider validating hash-based byte code [Python 2023 Command line and environment].

Python source code `.py` files need to be converted into "byte code" `.pyc` or `.pyo` in memory or in a filesystem `__pycache__` before running on the Python Virtual Machine (PVM) [Dec 2009 PEP 3147].
Python 3.8 [Dec 2009 PEP 3147] also has a backward compatibility mode supporting delivering only byte code.

Python 3.8 introduced the option to customize the `__pycache__` folder via `-X pycache_prefix=PATH`, or the `PYTHONPYCACHEPREFIX` environment variable. An attacker may manipulate the `PYTHONPYCACHEPREFIX` or `PYTHONPATH` to inject their code that can go unnoticed without hash-based verification. Without `--check-hash-based-pycs` Python only compares the byte code against the source code via a timestamp [Python 2023 The import system], potentially allowing an attack.

Python 2.6 also introduced the ability to stop Python from writing "byte code" files via the `-B` flag or `PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1` environment variable. However, this does not guarantee full protection.

Byte code files contain a 32-bit 'magic number' to identify the byte code format to determine if the PVM matches. Byte code also uses a naming convention to match up the CPython interpreter down to its minor version, such as `sessions.cpython-39.pyc` for the sessions module compiled with CPython 3.9.

## Non-Compliant Code Example

Setting `--check-hash-based-pycs` to `default` or `never` skips integrity verification of the byte code against its source code and only compares timestamp and size.

The following `noncompliant01.bash` code uses the Python standard library `http.server` as an example of a Python process started from a bash script without hash-based verification:

*[noncompliant01.bash](noncompliant01.bash):*

```bash
# Non-compliant Code Example
python3 -m http.server -b 127.0.0.42 8080
```

An attacker can exploit this by manipulating the `PYTHONPATH` to inject their code that can go unnoticed without hash-based verification as shown in the following example:

*[example01.bash](example01.bash)*

```bash
cd
CWD=$(pwd)
mkdir -p temp/http
touch temp/http/__init__.py
echo "print('hello there')" > temp/http/server.py
export PYTHONPATH=$CWD/temp/

# and now launch again
python3 -m http.server -b 127.0.0.42 8080
```

The `http.server` module is now launched from the `PYTHONPATH` and only prints "hello there" instead of launching the web server.

## Compliant Solution

In the following compliant solution, a user custom `PYTHONPATH` is suppressed with the `-I` isolation flag. This isolates the environment to avoid malicious code injection via `PYTHONPATH`. Additionally, using `--check-hash-based-pycs always` enforces hash-based integrity verification of byte code files against their source code files.

compliant01.bash:

*[compliant01.bash](compliant01.bash):*

```bash
# Compliant Code Example
python3 -I --check-hash-based-pycs always -m http.server -b 127.0.0.42 8080
```

## Exceptions

**ENV-4P-EX0:** Untrusted entities are not able to change environmental variables or any Python files.

## Automated Detection

Currently None.
